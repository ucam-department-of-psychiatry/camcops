CamCOPS Windows service
=======================

The most convenient way of running a CamCOPS server under Windows is via a
service.

The service starts the following:

- the CamCOPS web server, via CherryPy_ (equivalent to running ``camcops_server
  serve_cherrypy``);

- the CamCOPS scheduler, via Celery_ (equivalent to running ``camcops_server
  launch_scheduler``);

- the CamCOPS back-end worker processes, via Celery_ (equivalent to running
  ``camcops_server launch_workers``).

To create a Windows service for CamCOPS, use the ``camcops_windows_service``
command. You will need to run it from a command prompt with Administrator
authority.

Before starting the server, ensure you have set the following two system
environment variables:

- ``CAMCOPS_WINSERVICE_LOGDIR``, determining where disk logs are stored;
- ``CAMCOPS_CONFIG_FILE``, governing which config file will be used.

Logs from CamCOPS go to files in the directory specified by the environment
variable. However, output from the service itself goes to the Windows operating
system logs: see :menuselection:`Event Viewer --> Windows Logs -->
Application`.
