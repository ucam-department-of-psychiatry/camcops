Upgrading a CamCOPS server
==========================

This involves two steps: upgrading CamCOPS itself, then upgrading the CamCOPS
server database(s).


Upgrade the CamCOPS software
----------------------------

For Linux, this script will automate much of the work:

.. literalinclude:: upgrade_camcops_server.sh
    :language: bash


Upgrade the CamCOPS database
----------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    # For example:
    sudo camcops_server upgrade_db --config /etc/camcops/camcops.conf

    # Notes:
    # - "sudo" only so that CamCOPS can read the config file
    # - Use your installation-specific config file!

For more detail, see :ref:`camcops_server <camcops_cli>`.
