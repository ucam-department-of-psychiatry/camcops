usage: create_database_migration.py [-h] [--verbose] message

Create database revision. Note:

- The config used will be that from the environment variable
  CAMCOPS_CONFIG_FILE (currently '/path/to/camcops/config_file.ini').

- Alembic compares (a) the current state of the DATABASE to (b) the state of
  the SQLAlchemy metadata (i.e. the CODE). It creates a migration file to
  change the database to match the code.

- Accordingly, in the rare event of wanting to do a fresh start, you need an
  *empty* database.

- More commonly, you want a database that is synced to a specific Alembic
  version (with the correct structure, and the correct version in the
  alembic_version table). If you have made manual changes, such that the actual
  database structure doesn't match the structure that Alembic expects based on
  that version, there's likely to be trouble.
