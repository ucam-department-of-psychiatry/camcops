Notes
~~~~~

- Pronounced "kye-tee" (by analogy to chi, chi-square), not "chit" (personal
  communication, task authors to Martin Burchell, Feb 2023).

- Prior to CamCOPS v2.4.15 the 15 items were rated on a 4-point scale (scoring
  0–3: 0 strongly disagree, 1 disagree, 2 agree, 3 strongly agree), for a total
  score of 45, and there was an additional question about subjective impairment
  with a yes/no answer. This reflects the original version used in Chamberlain
  & Grant (2018), and CHI-T v1.0 by internal numbering.

- From CamCOPS v2.4.25, the range is 0–4 (0 strongly disagree, 1 disagree, 2
  neither agree nor disagree, 3 agree, 4 strongly agree). The 15 questions are
  unchanged.  This takes the total score to 60, and the additional yes/no
  question is no longer used. This reflects the version used for large-scale
  validation by Tiego et al. (2023), and CHI-T v1.1 by internal numbering. It
  is intended to replace the previous version.
