See Spitzer et al. (2006) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16717171) and the
instructions (http://www.phqscreeners.com/instructions/instructions.pdf).

89%, specificity 82% (Spitzer et al. 2006,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16717171).

A score of ≥10 identifies panic disorder with sensitivity 74%, specificity 81%
(Kroenke et al. 2010, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20633738).

A score of ≥10 identifies social anxiety with sensitivity 72%, specificity 80%
(Kroenke et al. 2010).

Notes
~~~~~

- CamCOPS does not suffer and has not suffered from the GAD-7 reproduction
  error noted by Zorowitz et al. (2021), *Lancet Psychiatry* 8: 180,
  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33610220/,
  https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(21)00001-8.
  (The error, noted in a large number of publications, was to use “not at all
  sure” as the “zero” or lowest-value response, which is incorrect, rather than
  the correct option of “not at all”.) Checked on 2022-01-05.
