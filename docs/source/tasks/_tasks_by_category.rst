Set menus for research
----------------------

|sets_research|

Individual research projects may have specific menus of tasks created. As well
as generic tasks listed above, there are some very specific ones, as follows.

- :ref:`Deakin JB — Antibody-mediated psychosis study — health review
  <deakin_s1_healthreview>`

- :ref:`Khandaker GM — Insight study — medical history
  <khandaker_insight_medical>`

  <khandaker_mojo_medicationtherapy>`

- :ref:`Lynall M-E — IAM study — medical history <lynall_iam_medical>`

- :ref:`Lynall M-E — IAM study — life events <lynall_iam_life>`


Set menus for clinical purposes
-------------------------------

|sets_clinical|

Individual clinical services or contexts may have specific menus of tasks
created. Amongst them are the :ref:`FROM-LP <from_lp>` and :ref:`FROM-Perinatal
<from_perinatal>` sets.


.. _from_lp:

The FROM-LP framework
---------------------

|sets_clinical|

FROM-LP is the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Framework for Routine Outcome
Measurement in Liaison Psychiatry.

**The FROM-LP generic measures are:**

*Process*

- a measure of response time;

- :ref:`Identify and Rate the Aim of the Contact (IRAC) <irac>`
  (Trigwell P, 2014a).

*Outcomes (clinician-rated)*

- :ref:`Clinical Global Impression – Improvement (CGI-I) <cgi_i>`

*Outcomes (patient-rated)*

- :ref:`Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation 10 (CORE-10) <core10>`

*Patient satisfaction*

- :ref:`Patient Satisfaction Scale (PSS) <pss>` (Persaud A et al. 2008).

- :ref:`Friends and Family Test (FFT) <fft>` (Department of Health, 2012).

*Referrer satisfaction*

- Referrer Satisfaction Scale (RSS) (Trigwell P, 2014b, after Persaud A et al.
  2008). CamCOPS supports two versions of the RSS:

  - :ref:`Referrer Satisfaction Scale (survey version) <rss_survey>`

  - :ref:`Referrer Satisfaction Scale (patient-specific version)
    <rss_patient_specific>`

**The FROM-LP condition-specific measures are:**

- Dementia: the :ref:`ACE-R <ace_r>`.

  - In CamCOPS, see the :ref:`Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination, revision 3
    (ACE-III) <ace3>` instead.

- Depressive disorders: the :ref:`Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)
  <phq9>`.

- Postnatal depression: the :ref:`Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)
  <epds>`.

- Anxiety disorders: the :ref:`Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7)
  <gad7>`.

- Psychosis: the :ref:`Health of the Nation Outcome Scales: HoNOS <honos>`.

- Alcohol: the :ref:`AUDIT Alcohol Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) <audit_c>`.

- Eating disorders: :ref:`Body mass index (BMI) <bmi>`.

- Medically unexplained symptoms: the :ref:`EQ-5D-5L <eq5d5l>`.
