Caveat
~~~~~~

*(Personal communication, Ian F. Brockington to Jo Peterkin, 2019-04-02.)*

    "It is important to remember that the PBQ is merely a screening
    questionnaire. If the scores are high (especially the score on Factor 2),
    it is essential to interview the mother about her responses to the
    questionnaire and her feelings about the infant, including her anger. We
    recommend the Stafford Interview, developed over the course of 22 years and
    also widely translated: pages 66-71 are devoted to the mother-infant
    relationship."
