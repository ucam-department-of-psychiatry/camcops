PTSD Checklist: DSM-5 Version (PCL-5)
-------------------------------------

For post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

History and guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The PCL for the DSM-IV has three versions, PCL-M (military), PCL-C
  (civilian), and PCL-S (specific). See the :ref:`PCL-C <pcl_c>`.

- The PCL-5 (for DSM-5) is most similar to the PCL-S (specific), but the
  scoring system is different. There are no corresponding PCL-M or PCL-C
  versions of the PCL-5.
