Fast Alcohol Screening Test (FAST)

Notes on the method of administration and scoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is slightly trickier than it appears at first glance -- there are a
couple of administration guidelines that differ very slightly, but the scoring
method is consistent.

**Development**

Hodgson et al. [#hodgson2002]_ developed the FAST from the AUDIT, seeking a
quick version. They had the aim that one question serves as a first filter.
AUDIT Q3 was found to be good for that. They modified it to use a threshold of
≥8 units for men. They found that AUDIT Q5, Q8, and Q10 were collectively the
best for a second-stage filter, with minor modifications.

The four FAST questions are therefore approximately as follows:

- FAST Q1: How often ≥6 units (female) or ≥8 units (male) on a single
  occasion in the last year? = AUDIT Q3, approximately, but not quite.
- FAST Q2: ... failed to do what was normally expected... = AUDIT Q5.
- FAST Q3: ... unable to remember... the night before... = AUDIT Q8.
- FAST Q4: ... relative/friend/doctor/health professional... concerned = AUDIT
  Q10.

The test is referred to as a two-stage screening test (e.g. Abstract).

**Administration**

There seems to be a slight difference in administration instructions between
different sources of the test.

The original paper [#hodgson2002]_ says (p62): *"AUDIT Question 3 [= FAST Q1]...
served as the best first filter... If the response is 'never'... then there is
no hazardous use. If the response is 'weekly'/'daily or almost daily'... then
there is probably hazardous use... this one questions classifies... 66%... with
an accuracy of 97%. Only the 34% of patients who responded 'less than monthly'
or 'monthly' to [AUDIT] Question 3 [FAST Q1] need to be asked further
questions"*.

The FAST manual says that *"a response must be obtained for each question... In
the case of self-completion, a staff member... should check that all questions
have been answered"* ([#fastmanual]_, page 6), although it is not necessary to
score all (depending on Q1). There is no suggestion that one should not
*answer* Q2-Q4 if certain answers are given to Q1. The paper version of the
test simply says *"For the following questions, please circle the answer..."*

Public Health England says that *"the test consists of only 4 questions... which
are asked in 2 stages"* [#phegeneral]_. It clarifies that one should *"only
answer the following questions [Q2-Q4] if the answer above [to Q1] is Never
(0), Less than monthly (1) or Monthly (2). Stop here if the answer is Weekly
(3) or Daily (4)"* ([#phefast]_, page 1).

I presume that PHE trimmed the administration procedure a little for speed,
without any change to the scoring methodology (see below).

**Scoring**

Hodgson et al. [#hodgson2002]_ considered two scoring methods (p64):

- Both methods decide "FAST negative" if the response to Q1 is "Never".
- Both methods decide "FAST positive" if the response to Q1 is "weekly" or
  "daily or almost daily".

Then:

- Method 1 (not preferred): FAST negative if (FAST) Q2 and Q3 are "Never" and
  Q4 is "No"; FAST positive for all others (i.e. positive for any hint of a
  problem).

- Method 2 (preferred): all questions are scored 0-4 and the result is FAST
  positive if the total score for all four questions is ≥3.

  - In more detail: questions Q1-Q3 have five options and are scored 0-4;
    question Q4 has three options, scored 0, 2, and 4.

The original paper prefers Method 2 [#hodgson2002]_.

The FAST manual uses Method 2 [#fastmanual]_.

The PHE scoring method is Method 2 [#phefast]_.

So that's clear.

*CamCOPS*

CamCOPS marks all four questions as mandatory, following the FAST manual, and
following the principle of collecting more data (given also some ambiguity) in
a patient-completed questionnaire. Note also that the original validation
involved a questionnaire in which participants saw and answered all four
questions.

Reviewed 2019-11-01. The scoring method was correct; see ``fast.cpp`` in the
:ref:`source code <sourcecode>` and
:meth:`camcops_server.tasks.fast.Fast.is_positive`. Explanatory text added
