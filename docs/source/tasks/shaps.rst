Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)
--------------------------------------

.. include:: include_data_collection_plus_local_upgrade.rst

A scale to measure hedonic tone. 14 questions rated on a 4-item scale
(definitely agree - strongly disagree or strongly disagree - strongly agree).
Scored 1 point for either "disagree" rating, 0 for either "agree" rating.
Note that high scores represent low pleasure.

Several studies using the scale have made the responses consistent. Franken et
al (2007) below uses definitely agree - definitely disagree. See also:
