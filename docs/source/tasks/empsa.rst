Eating and Meal Preparation Skills Assessment (EMPSA)
-----------------------------------------------------

A 12-item self-report assessment tool designed to measure eating disordered
clients' perceived ability and motivation to perform 12 eating and meal
preparation tasks.

Eating and Meal Preparation Skills Assessment scores range from 0 (no
ability/motivation) to 10 (total ability/motivation), and clients are given the
opportunity to add qualitative comments regarding each of the 12 tasks. The mean
of these scores provided a subscale score for both Ability and Motivation.

- PDF emailed from Amy Shears (Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation
  Trust, CPFT) to CamCOPS developers via Jeremy Solly (Cambridgeshire and
  Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, CPFT) on 3rd December 2024. The table of
  questions is identical to that in the Appendix of Lock et al. (2012) above.


Notes
~~~~~

The original instructions include the prompt "Please rate yourself from 1 to 10
in the following areas", but then offer the anchor "0 = no ability/motivation"
(for example: page 224 of Lock et al. 2012, as above, and the scanned PDF
version). The text of the paper (e.g. page 220) makes it clear that 0-10 is
intended. The scanned PDF version also includes the "1 to 10" prompt but 0/10
anchors. This was clarified by the creator (Laura Lock to Rudolf Cardinal,
2025-07-01), that [the prompt] "should read 0 to 10 as you suggest". The
CamCOPS implementation therefore amends the prompt to "Please rate yourself
from 0 to 10..." and retains the 0/10 anchors.
