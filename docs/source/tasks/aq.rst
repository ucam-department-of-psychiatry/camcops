Adult Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)
-----------------------------------

.. include:: include_permission_contextual.rst

A 50-item self-administered instrument for measuring the degree to which an
adult with normal intelligence has the traits associated with the autistic
spectrum.

The 50 questions are made up of 10 questions assessing five different areas:

- social skill (items 1, 11, 13, 15, 22, 36, 44, 45, 47, 48);
- attention switching (items 2, 4, 10, 16, 25, 32, 34, 37, 43, 46);
- attention to detail (items 5, 6, 9, 12, 19, 23, 28, 29, 30, 49);
- communication (items 7, 17, 18, 26, 27, 31, 33, 35, 38, 39);
- imagination (items 3, 8, 14, 20, 21, 24, 40, 41, 42, 50).

Each question is scored as either 0 or 1, where 1 indicates a response more in
keeping with an autistic spectrum trait (see Baron-Cohen et al. 2001, p6-7).
The total score is therefore in the range 0-50. For some questions, agreement
("slightly agree" or "definitely agree") is associated with the response more
in keeping with autistic spectrum traits, and for some, disagreement ("slightly
disagree" or "definitely disagree") scores that point.
