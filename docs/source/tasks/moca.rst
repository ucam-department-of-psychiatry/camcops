History and guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Original: Nasreddine et al. (2005), https://www.pubmed.gov/15817019.

In a study of normal controls, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild
Alzheimer's disease (AlzD), a MoCA score of <26 had 90% sensitivity for MCI,
100% sensitivity for AlzD, and a specificity of 87% (Nasreddine et al. 2005).

Intellectual property rights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Copyright © Ziad Nasreddin. See https://www.mocatest.org/.

- Initially, in Sep 2012:

  - Reproducible without permission for non-commercial clinical/educational
    use.

  - Permission required for research or commercial use.

  - No special restrictions were placed on electronic versions.

  - As per http://www.mocatest.org/permission.asp, accessed 2012-09-13, now
    gone but archived at
    https://web.archive.org/web/20120904234436/http://www.mocatest.org/permission.asp.

- **Update,** Mar 2021:

  - As of Apr 2021 (delayed from Sep 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic),
    it is now "mandatory" to be trained (by the MoCA group) to use the MoCA.
    The site adds: "If you wish to continue using the MoCA Test without being
    officially trained and certified, you will be at increased risk for
    administration, scoring and interpretation errors which could lead to
    misdiagnosis and liability". See https://www.mocatest.org/permission/,
    accessed 2021-03-16, archived at
    https://web.archive.org/web/20210226172214/https://www.mocatest.org/permission/.

  - Development of electronic versions is now prohibited.

    - Note that a MoCA app was released in May 2017
      (see
      https://web.archive.org/web/20210118041142/https://www.mocatest.org/faq/)
      and is available (for iOS) from
      https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moca-app/id1206246590.

  - It remains that case that for "Universities / Foundations / Health
    Professionals / Hospitals / Clinics / Public Health Institutes", "MoCA© may
    be used, reproduced, and distributed WITHOUT permission" for clinical
    and educational use, and "WITH permission" for research use (*ibidem*).

  - As a result of the new prohibition on electronic reproduction,
    **the MoCA can no longer be properly functional within CamCOPS** (your
    institution would need to obtain specific permissions to reproduce it
    electronically, and ensure that all users are suitably trained).

  - Old CamCOPS data will not be deleted, of course; the data are separate from
    the task. The task persists as a "skeleton" without actual task content.

- See also alternatives, e.g. the :ref:`ACE-III <ace3>`.
