Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS28)
---------------------------------

.. include:: include_data_collection_plus_local_upgrade.rst

Disease activity score for rheumatoid arthritis. The 28 refers to the number
of joints in which disease activity is rated (bilaterally: shoulder, elbow,
wrist, knee, 5 × MCP, 5 × PIP).

For each joint, "swollen?" and "tender?" are asked; there is a visual analogue
rating scale (100 mm in length) for arthritis activity, plus an inflammatory
marker. In the original DAS28 (sometimes termed the DAS28-ESR), this was ESR
(erythrocyte sedimentation rate). An alternative is the CRP (C-reactive
protein), in the DAS28-CRP.

- t28 = number of tender joints, range [0, 28].

- sw28 = number of swollen joints, range [0, 28].

- The CRP units are mg/L, constrained to be integer and in the range [0, 300].

- The ESR units are mm/hr, constrained to be integer and in the range [1, 300].

- The VAS units are mm, range [0, 100]. Low is inactive arthritis; high is
  extremely active arthritis.

DAS28 score = 0.56 × √(t28) + 0.28 × √(sw28) + 0.70 × ln(ESR) + 0.014 × VAS

DAS28-CRP score = 0.56 × √(t28) + 0.28 × √(sw28) + 0.36 × ln(CRP + 1) + 0.014 ×
VAS + 0.96.
