EuroQol 5-Dimension, 5-Level Health Scale (EQ-5D-5L)
----------------------------------------------------

.. include:: include_data_collection_plus_local_upgrade.rst

A descriptive system comprising five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual
activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5
levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and
extreme problems. The second task component is a visual scale wherein the
patient is asked to rate their health on a scale of 0 to 100.

EQ-5D-5L evolved from EQ-5D-3L, as the five level classifier provided greater
discriminative ability and more power to detect differences between groups.
