    # One might think that we want records to be unique by id [within a
    # client's database] and _device_id/_era [defining a moment on a client's
    # database]. However, when we upload, a new record is inserted, and if the
    # upload succeeds, the old record is moved to a different era. But during
    # that moment of upload, the two appear to clash. The extra constraint is
    # that only one record with the combination of id/_device_id/era may also
    # be _current. Furthermore, non-current versions show a history trail of
    # uploads from the client, and so may be non-unique even within a given
    # era.
    #
    # In other words, non-current versions don't have to have that constraint.
    #
    # To implement such a constraint...
