**Constants for languages/internationalization.**

This represents known languages (or, strictly, locales). Compare
``language.cpp`` on the client.

At present we don't make this user-configurable and arbitrary (e.g. via an XML
file to define languages), largely because it would a little complexity for the
user, and because there's not much point in adding a language to the server
without adding it for the client, too -- and the client needs recompiling.

Note that both Python locales (see e.g. ``locale.getlocale()``) and Qt use
underscores -- e.g. ``en_GB`` -- so we will too.
