def upload_commit_order_sorter(x: Table) -> Tuple[bool, bool, bool, str]:
    """
    Function to sort tables for the commit phase of the upload.
    
    - "patient" must come before "patient_idnum", since ID number indexing
      looks at the associated Patient.
      
    - All of "patient", "blobs", and all ancillary tables must come before task
      tables, because task indexes depend on tasks correctly retrieving their
      subsidiary information to determine their
      :meth:`camcops_server.cc_modules.cc_task.Task.is_complete` status.
      (However, even though ancillary tables can refer to BLOBs, as long as
      both are complete before the task tables are examined, their relative
      order doesn't matter.)

    - Task tables come last.

    Args:
        x: an SQLAlchemy :class:`Table`

    Returns:
        a tuple suitable for use as the key to a ``sort()`` or ``sorted()``
        operation

    Note that ``False`` sorts before ``True``, and see
