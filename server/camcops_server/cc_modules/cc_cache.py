1. The basic cache objects.

2. FIX FOR DOGPILE.CACHE FOR DECORATED FUNCTIONS, 2017-07-28 (PLUS SOME OTHER
   IMPROVEMENTS). SEE 
   https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/dogpile.cache/issues/96/error-in-python-35-with-use-of-deprecated

Crash using type-hinted functions under Python 3.5 with dogpile.cache==0.6.4:

3. CACHING NOTES

- We currently use 'dogpile.cache.memory' as the backend.
  This means that for single-process (single-thread or multithreaded) servers,
  the cache is unique, but that won't work for multi-process (e.g. Gunicorn)
  servers.
  
- That means that in a multiprocess environment it's fine to continue to use a
  memory cache for file-based stuff (e.g. configs, XML strings), but not for
  database-based stuff (e.g. which ID numbers are valid).
  
- Correct solutions WITH a cache for those database-based things include:

  - ignoring Python caching and relying on the MySQL query cache -- but this is 
    being removed because it's not all that great:
    
    http://mysqlserverteam.com/mysql-8-0-retiring-support-for-the-query-cache/
    
  - using memcached (via dogpile.cache.pylibmc)
  
    http://www.ubergizmo.com/how-to/install-memcached-windows/

  - using redis (via dogpile.cache.redis and
    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/redis/ )

    http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/take-advantage-of-redis-adding-it-to-your-stack.html
    https://redis.io/topics/security
    
    redis unsupported under Windows:
        https://redis.io/download
        
- The other obvious alternative: don't cache such stuff! This may all be
  premature optimization.
  
  https://msol.io/blog/tech/youre-probably-wrong-about-caching/
  
  The actual price is of the order of 0.6-1 ms per query, for the queries
  "find me all the ID number definitions" and "fetch the server settings".
  
- The answer is probably:

  - continue to use dogpile.cache.memory for simple "fixed" stuff read from 
    disk;
  - continue to use Pyramid's per-request caching mechanism (@reify);
  - forget about database caching for now;
  - if it becomes a problem later, move to Redis

- Therefore:

  - there should be no calls to cache_region_static.delete
