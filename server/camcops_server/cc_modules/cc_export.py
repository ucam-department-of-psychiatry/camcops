**Export and research dump functions.**

Export design:

*WHICH RECORDS TO SEND?*

The most powerful mechanism is not to have a sending queue (which would then
require careful multi-instance locking), but to have a "sent" log. That way:

- A record needs sending if it's not in the sent log (for an appropriate
  recipient).
- You can add a new recipient and the system will know about the (new)
  backlog automatically.
- You can specify criteria, e.g. don't upload records before 1/1/2014, and
  modify that later, and it would catch up with the backlog.
- Successes and failures are logged in the same table.
- Multiple recipients are handled with ease.
- No need to alter database.pl code that receives from tablets.
- Can run with a simple cron job.

*LOCKING*

- Don't use database locking:
  https://blog.engineyard.com/2011/5-subtle-ways-youre-using-mysql-as-a-queue-and-why-itll-bite-you
- Locking via UNIX lockfiles:

  - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lockfile
  - http://pythonhosted.org/lockfile/ (which also works on Windows)

  - On UNIX, ``lockfile`` uses ``LinkLockFile``:
    https://github.com/smontanaro/pylockfile/blob/master/lockfile/linklockfile.py

*MESSAGE QUEUE AND BACKEND*

Thoughts as of 2018-12-22.

- See https://www.fullstackpython.com/task-queues.html. Also http://queues.io/;
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/731233/activemq-or-rabbitmq-or-zeromq-or.

- The "default" is Celery_, with ``celery beat`` for scheduling, via an
  AMQP_ broker like RabbitMQ_.

  - Downside: no longer supported under Windows as of Celery 4.

    - There are immediate bugs when running the demo code with Celery 4.2.1,
      fixed by setting the environment variable ``set
      FORKED_BY_MULTIPROCESSING=1`` before running the worker; see
      https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/4178 and
      https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/4078.

  - Downside: backend is complex; e.g. Erlang dependency of RabbitMQ.

  - Celery also supports Redis_, but Redis_ doesn't support Windows directly
    (except the Windows Subsystem for Linux in Windows 10+).

- Another possibility is Dramatiq_ with APScheduler_.

  - Of note, APScheduler_ can use an SQLAlchemy database table as its job
    store, which might be good.
  - Dramatiq_ uses RabbitMQ_ or Redis_.
  - Dramatiq_ 1.4.0 (2018-11-25) installs cleanly under Windows. Use ``pip
    install --upgrade "dramatic[rabbitmq, watch]"`` (i.e. with double quotse,
    not the single quotes it suggests, which don't work under Windows).
  - However, the basic example (https://dramatiq.io/guide.html) fails under
    Windows; when you fire up ``dramatic count_words`` (even with ``--processes
    1 --threads 1``) it crashes with an error from ``ForkingPickler`` in
    ``multiprocessing.reduction``, i.e.
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#windows. It also
    emits a ``PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied``. This is
    discussed a bit at https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/issues/75;
    https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/blob/master/docs/source/changelog.rst.
    The changelog suggests 1.4.0 should work, but it doesn't.

- Worth some thought about ZeroMQ_, which is a very different sort of thing.
  Very cross-platform. Needs work to guard against message loss (i.e. messages
  are unreliable by default). Dynamic "special socket" style.

- Possibly also ActiveMQ_.

- OK; so speed is not critical but we want message reliability, for it to work
  under Windows, and decent Python bindings with job scheduling.

  - OUT: Redis (not Windows easily), ZeroMQ (fast but not by default reliable),
    ActiveMQ (few Python frameworks?).
  - REMAINING for message handling: RabbitMQ.
  - Python options therefore: Celery (but Windows not officially supported from
    4+); Dramatiq (but Windows also not very well supported and seems a bit
    bleeding-edge).

- This is looking like a mess from the Windows perspective.

- An alternative is just to use the database, of course.

- Let's take a step back and summarize the problem.

  - Many web threads may upload tasks. This should trigger a prompt export for
    all push recipients.
  - Whichever way we schedule a backend task job, it should be as the
    combination of recipient, basetable, task PK. (That way, if one recipient
    fails, the others can proceed independently.)
  - Every job should check that it's not been completed already (in case of
    accidental job restarts), i.e. is idempotent as far as we can make it.
  - How should this interact with the non-push recipients?
  - We should use the same locking method for push and non-push recipients.
  - We should make the locking granular and use file locks -- for example, for
    each task/recipient combination (or each whole-database export for a given
    recipient).
