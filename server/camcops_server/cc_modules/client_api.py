**Implements the API through which client devices (tablets etc.) upload and
download data.**

We use primarily SQLAlchemy Core here (in contrast to the ORM used elsewhere).

This code is optimized to a degree for speed over clarity, aiming primarily to
reduce the number of database hits.

**The overall upload method is as follows**

Everything that follows refers to records relating to a specific client device
in the "current" era, only.

In the preamble, the client:

- verifies authorization via :func:`op_check_device_registered` and
  :func:`op_check_upload_user_and_device`;
- fetches and checks server ID information via :func:`op_get_id_info`;
- checks its patients are acceptable via :func:`op_validate_patients`;
- checks which tables are permitted via :func:`op_get_allowed_tables`;
- performs some internal validity checks.

Then, in the usual stepwise upload:

- :func:`op_start_upload`

  - Rolls back any previous incomplete changes via :func:`rollback_all`.
  - Creates an upload batch, via :func:`get_batch_details_start_if_needed`.

- If were are in a preserving/finalizing upload: :func:`op_start_preservation`.

  - Marks all tables as dirty.
  - Marks the upload batch as a "preserving" batch.

- Then call some or all of:

  - For tables that are empty on the client, :func:`op_upload_empty_tables`.

    - Current client records are marked as ``_removal_pending``.
    - Any table that had previous client records is marked as dirty.
    - If preserving, any table without current records is marked as clean.

  - For tables that the client wishes to send in one go,
    :func:`op_upload_table`.

    - Find current server records.
    - Use :func:`upload_record_core` to add new records and modify existing
      ones, and :func:`flag_deleted` to delete ones that weren't on the client.
    - If any records are new, modified, or deleted, mark the table as dirty.
    - If preserving and there were no server records in this table, mark the
      table as clean.

  - For tables (e.g. BLOBs) that might be too big to send in one go:

    - client sends PKs to :func:`op_delete_where_key_not`, which "deletes" all
      other records, via :func:`flag_deleted_where_clientpk_not`.
    - client sends PK and timestamp values to :func:`op_which_keys_to_send`
    - server "deletes" records that are not in the list (via
      :func:`flag_deleted_where_clientpk_not`, which marks the table as dirty
      if any records were thus modified). Note REDUNDANCY here re
      :func:`op_delete_where_key_not`.
    - server tells the client which records are new or need to be updated
    - client sends each of those via :func:`op_upload_record`

      - Calls :func`upload_record_core`.
      - Marks the table as dirty, unless the client erroneously sent an
        unchanged record.

- In addition, specific records can be marked as ``_move_off_tablet``.

  - :func:`upload_record_core` checks this for otherwise "identical" records
    and applies that flag to the server.

- When the client's finished, it calls :func:`op_end_upload`.

  - Calls :func:`commit_all`;
  - ... which, for all dirty tables, calls :func:`commit_table`;
  - ... which executes the "add", "remove", and "preserve" functions for the
    table;
  - ... and triggers the updating of special server indexes on patient ID
    numbers and tasks, via :func:`update_indexes`.
  - At the end, :func:`commit_all` clears the dirty-table list.

There's a little bit of special code to handle old tablet software, too.

As of v2.3.0, the function :func:`op_upload_entire_database` does this in one
step (faster; for use if the network packets are not excessively large).

- Code relating to this uses ``batchdetails.onestep``.

**Setup for the upload code**

- Fire up a CamCOPS client with an empty database, e.g. from the build
  directory via

  .. code-block:: bash

    ./camcops --dbdir ~/tmp/camcops_client_test

- Fire up a web browser showing both (a) the task list via the index, and (b)
  the task list without using the index. We'll use this to verify correct
  indexing. **The two versions of the view should never be different.**

- Ensure the test client device has no current records (force-finalize if
  required).

- Ensure the server's index is proper. Run ``camcops_server reindex`` if
  required.

- If required, fire up MySQL with the server database. You may wish to use
  ``pager less -SFX``, for better display of large tables.

**Testing the upload code**

Perform the following steps both (1) with the client forced to the stepwise
upload method, and (2) with it forced to one-step upload.

Note that the number of patient ID numbers uploaded (etc.) is ignored below.

*Single record*

[Checked for one-step and multi-step upload, 2018-11-21.]

#.  Create a blank ReferrerSatisfactionSurvery (table ``ref_satis_gen``).
    This has the advantage of being an anonymous single-record task.

#.  Upload/copy.

    - The server log should show 1 × ref_satis_gen added.

    - The task lists should show the task as current and incomplete.

#.  Modify it, so it's complete.

#.  Upload/copy.

    - The server log should show 1 × ref_satis_gen added, 1 × ref_satis_gen
      modified out.

    - The task lists should show the task as current and complete.

#.  Upload/move.

    - The server log should show 2 × ref_satis_gen preserved.

    - The task lists should show the task as no longer current.

#.  Create another blank one.

#.  Upload/copy.

#.  Modify it so it's complete.

#.  Specifically flag it for preservation (the chequered flags).

#.  Upload/copy.

    - The server log should show 1 × ref_satis_gen added, 1 × ref_satis_gen
      modified out, 2 × ref_satis_gen preserved.

    - The task lists should show the task as complete and no longer current.

*With a patient*

[Checked for one-step and multi-step upload, 2018-11-21.]

#.  Create a dummy patient that the server will accept.

#.  Create a Progress Note with location "loc1" and abort its creation, giving
    an incomplete task.

#.  Create a second Progress Note with location "loc2" and contents "note2".

#.  Create a third Progress Note with location "loc3" and contents "note3".

#.  Upload/copy. Verify. This checks *addition*.

    - The server log should show 1 × patient added; 3 × progressnote added.
      (Also however many patientidnum records you chose.)
    - All three tasks should be "current".
    - The first should be "incomplete".

#.  Modify the first note by adding contents "note1".

#.  Delete the second note.

#.  Upload/copy. Verify. This checks *modification*, *deletion*,
    *no-change detection*, and *reindexing*.

    - The server log should show 1 × progressnote added, 1 × progressnote
      modified out, 1 × progressnote deleted.
    - The first note should now appear as complete.
    - The second should have vanished.
    - The third should be unchanged.
    - The two remaining tasks should still be "current".

#.  Delete the contents from the first note again.

#.  Upload/move (or move-keeping-patients; that's only different on the
    client side). Verify. This checks *preservation (finalizing)* and
    *reindexing*.

    - The server log should show 1 × patient preserved; 1 × progressnote added,
      1 × progressnote modified out, 5 × progressnote preserved.
    - The two remaining tasks should no longer be "current".
    - The first should no longer be "complete".

#.  Create a complete "note 4" and an incomplete "note 5".

#.  Upload/copy.

#.  Force-finalize from the server. This tests force-finalizing including
    reindexing.

    - The "tasks to finalize" list should have just two tasks in it.
    - After force-finalizing, the tasks should remain in the index but no
      longer be marked as current.

#.  Upload/move to get rid of the residual tasks on the client.

    - The server log should show 1 × patient added, 1 × patient preserved; 2 ×
      progressnote added, 2 × progressnote preserved.

*With ancillary tables and BLOBs*

[Checked for one-step and multi-step upload, 2018-11-21.]

#.  Create a PhotoSequence with text "t1", one photo named "p1" of you holding
    up one finger vertically, and another photo named "p2" of you holding up
    two fingers vertically.

#.  Upload/copy.

    - The server log should show:

      - blobs: 2 × added;
      - patient: 1 × added;
      - photosequence: 1 × added;
      - photosequence_photos: 2 × added.

    - The task lists should look sensible.

#.  Clear the second photo and replace it with a photo of you holding up
    two fingers horizontally.

#.  Upload/copy.

    - The server log should show:

      - blobs: 1 × added, 1 × modified out;
      - photosequence: 1 × added, 1 × modified out;
      - photosequence_photos: 1 × added, 1 × modified out.

    - The task lists should look sensible.

#.  Back to two fingers vertically. (This is the fourth photo overall.)

#.  Mark that patient for specific finalization.

#.  Upload/copy.

    - The server log should show:

      - blobs: 1 × added, 1 × modified out, 4 × preserved;
      - patient: 1 × preserved;
      - photosequence: 1 × added, 1 × modified out, 3 × preserved;
      - photosequence_photos: 1 × added, 1 × modified out, 4 × preserved.

    - The tasks should no longer be current.
    - A fresh "vertical fingers" photo should be visible.

#.  Create another patient and another PhotoSequence with one photo of three
    fingers.

#.  Upload-copy.

#.  Force-finalize.

    - Should finalize: 1 × blobs, 1 × patient, 1 × photosequence, 1 ×
      photosequence_photos.

#.  Upload/move.

During any MySQL debugging, remember:

.. code-block:: none

    -- For better display:
    pager less -SFX;

    -- To view relevant parts of the BLOB table without the actual BLOB:

    SELECT
        _pk, _group_id, _device_id, _era,
        _current, _predecessor_pk, _successor_pk,
        _addition_pending, _when_added_batch_utc, _adding_user_id,
        _removal_pending, _when_removed_batch_utc, _removing_user_id,
        _move_off_tablet,
        _preserving_user_id, _forcibly_preserved,
        id, tablename, tablepk, fieldname, mimetype, when_last_modified
    FROM blobs;
