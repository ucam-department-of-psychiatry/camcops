Custom views typically inherit from :class:`CreateView`, :class:`DeleteView` or
:class:`UpdateView`.

A Pyramid view function with a named route should create a view of the custom
class, passing in the request, and return the results of its ``dispatch()``
method. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    @view_config(route_name="edit_server_created_patient")
    def edit_server_created_patient(req: Request) -> Response:
        return EditServerCreatedPatientView(req).dispatch()

To provide a custom view class to create a new object in the database:

* Inherit from :class:`CreateView`.
* Set the ``object_class`` property.
* Set the ``form_class`` property.
* Set the ``template_name`` property.
* Override ``get_extra_context()`` for any extra parameters to pass to the
  template.
* Set ``success_url`` or override ``get_success_url()`` to be the redirect on
  successful creation.
* Override ``get_form_kwargs()`` for any extra parameters to pass to the form
  constructor.
* For simple views, set the ``model_form_dict`` property to be a mapping of
  object properties to form parameters.
* Override ``get_form_values()`` with any values additional to
  ``model_form_dict`` to populate the form.
* Override ``save_object()` to do anything more than a simple record save
  (saving related objects, for example).

To provide a custom view class to delete an object from the database:

* Inherit from :class:`DeleteView`.
* Set the ``object_class`` property.
* Set the ``form_class`` property.
* Set the ``template_name`` property.
* Override ``get_extra_context()``. for any extra parameters to pass to the
  template.
* Set ``success_url`` or override ``get_success_url()`` to be the redirect on
  successful creation.
* Override ``get_form_kwargs()`` for any extra parameters to pass to the form
  constructor.
* Set the ``pk_param`` property to be the name of the parameter in the request
  that holds the unique/primary key of the object to be deleted.
* Set the ``server_pk_name`` property to be the name of the property on the
  object that is the unique/primary key.
* Override ``get_object()`` if the object cannot be retrieved with the above.
* Override ``delete()`` to do anything more than a simple record delete; for
  example, to delete dependant objects

To provide a custom view class to update an object in the database:

* Inherit from :class:`UpdateView`.
* Set the ``object_class`` property.
* Set the ``form_class`` property.
* Set the ``template_name`` property.
* Override ``get_extra_context()`` for any extra parameters to pass to the
  template.
* Set ``success_url`` or override ``get_success_url()`` to be the redirect on
  successful creation.
* Override ``get_form_kwargs()`` for any extra parameters to pass to the form
  constructor.
* Set the ``pk_param`` property to be the name of the parameter in the request
  that holds the unique/primary key of the object to be updated.
* Set the ``server_pk_name`` property to be the name of the property on the
  object that is the unique/primary key.
* Override ``get_object()`` if the object cannot be retrieved with the above.
* For simple views, set the ``model_form_dict`` property to be a mapping of
  object properties to form parameters.
* Override ``save_object()`` to do anything more than a simple record save
  (saving related objects, for example).

You can use mixins for settings common to multiple views.

.. note::

    When we move to Python 3.8, there is ``typing.Protocol``, which allows
    mixins to be type-checked properly. Currently we suppress warnings.

Some examples are in ``webview.py``.
