    <!--
      RNC, re Q16: A comma after "interests" is absent in the ARC's Word
      version, but present in Baron-Cohen et al. (2001). Per e.g. Butterfield,
      J. (2015) "Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage", fourth edition,
      under the entry for "that (relative pronoun)": "which" can be restrictive
      (without comma) or non-restrictive (with comma), though many feel that
      "that" is obligatory for restrictive clauses (thus preferring always: "X
      that Y" for restrictive or "X, which Y" for non-restrictive). Here, a
      restrictive meaning is likely intended (if one had strong interests but
      did not get upset if one could not pursue them, one would likely answer
      no); otherwise, the second half of the clause would be redundant.
      Butterfield considers it grammatically correct, if more unusual, to have
      a non-restrictive clause with "which", and we are not going to change the
      text, of course, so we will follow the ARC's original version rather than
      the Baron-Cohen et al. (2001) version (which was potentially copy-edited
      thus by the journal). (References are in aq.rst.)

        RNC, re Q49: Singular "date" contravenes grammatical agreement with
        "people" (they do not all share one date of birth) but is in both the
        ARC and the Baron-Cohen et al. (2001) published version.
