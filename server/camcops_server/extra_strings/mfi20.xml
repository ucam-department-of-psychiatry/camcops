         By means of the following statements we would like to get an idea of how you have been feeling lately. There is, for example, the statement:
         “I FEEL RELAXED”
         If you think that this is entirely true, that indeed you have been feeling relaxed lately, please place an X in the extreme left box, like this:
         yes, that is true 1       2       3       4       5 no, that is not true
         The more you disagree with the statement, the more you can place an X in the direction of “no, that is not true”. Please do not miss out a statement and place only one X in a box for each statement.
