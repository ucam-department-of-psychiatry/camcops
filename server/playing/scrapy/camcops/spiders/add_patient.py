Temporary test script for generating potential race conditions when adding
new patients.

Note hardcoded URLs, admin credentials.
Also assumes there is a task schedule with ID 3 and a patient idnum with
which_idnum = 1

Usage:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install scrapy
    cd server/playing/scrapy/camcops
    scrapy crawl add-patient-spider
