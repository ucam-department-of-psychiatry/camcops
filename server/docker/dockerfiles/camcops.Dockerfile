# Directory structure in container:
#
#   /camcops            All CamCOPS code/binaries.
#       /cfg            Config files are mounted here.
#       /src            Source code for CamCOPS server.
#       /venv           Python 3 virtual environment.
#           /bin        Main "camcops_server" executable lives here.


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# FROM: Base image
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - Avoid Alpine Linux?
#   https://pythonspeed.com/articles/base-image-python-docker-images/
# - python:3.6-slim-buster? This is a Debian distribution ("buster" is Debian
#   10). Seems to work fine.
# - ubuntu:18.04? Requires "apt install python3" or similar? Quite tricky.
#   Also larger.

FROM python:3.9-slim-bullseye

# ... note that "-bullseye" (not "-slim-bullseye") includes some things we need,
# but is LARGER overall.

# ADD: files to copy
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - Syntax: ADD <host_file_spec> <container_dest_dir>
# - The host file spec is relative to the context (and can't go "above" it).
# - This docker file lives in the "server/docker/dockerfiles" directory within
#   the CamCOPS source, so we expect Docker to be told (externally -- see e.g.
#   the Docker Compose file) that the context is a higher directory, "server/".
#   That is the directory containing "setup.py" and therefore the installation
#   directory for our Python package.
# - So in short, here we refer to the context as ".".

ADD . /camcops/src


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WORKDIR: Set working directory on container.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Shouldn't really be necessary.

WORKDIR /camcops


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RUN: run a command.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - A venv is not necessarily required. Our "system" Python only exists to run
#   CamCOPS -- though other things may be installed by the OS.
#   However, we'll use one; it improves predictability.
#
# - Watch out for apt-get:

#   - https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#run
#
# - There is also something good about minimizing the number of RUN commands:

#
# Install packages for the operating system.
#
# - gcc: required by some Python packages (e.g. psutil)
# - gdebi: allows us to auto-install dependencies when installing .deb files
#   quasi-manually
# - git: because we are currently using a git-based development package via
#   setup.py
# - libmagickwand-dev: ImageMagick, used by CamCOPS
# - libmysqlclient-dev: for MySQL access (needed by Python mysqlclient package)
#   ... replaced by libmariadb-dev in Debian 11
# - wget: for fetching other stuff! See below.
# - wait-for-it: wait for a host/TCP port (to synchronize containers)
#
# Not now needed:
#
# - python3-tk: Tkinter for Python, not installed by default
#   ... necessity removed 2020-06-28
# - python3-dev: some Python packages require it
#   ... seems to be present anyway
#
# Also, install wkhtmltopdf in a different way, as above.
#
# - wkhtmltopdf is required by CamCOPS for PDF generation. However, the Debian
#   version (0.12.5) is NOT the "patched Qt" edition, so we have to do that
#   more "manually". See
#   - https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html
#   - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38262173/how-to-correctly-install-wkhtmltopdf-on-debian-64-bit
#   EXCEPT that although the Debian version says:
#
#   Reduced Functionality:
#     This version of wkhtmltopdf has been compiled against a version of QT without
#     the wkhtmltopdf patches. Therefore some features are missing, if you need
#     these features please use the static version.
#     Currently the list of features only supported with patch QT includes:
#    - Printing more than one HTML document into a PDF file.
#    - Running without an X11 server.
#
#   ... it does actually run without an X11 server.
#   However, it doesn't add headers/footers to PDFs. So, we need the "patched
#   Qt" version still -- and hence wget, gdebi, etc.
#
# Then
#
# - Make /var/lock/camcops
# - Make /var/tmp/camcops
# - Use system python3 to create Python virtual environment (venv).
# - Upgrade pip within virtual environment.
# - Install CamCOPS in virtual environment.
# - Install MySQL drivers for Python. Use a C-based one for speed.
#   - use mysqlclient
#   - version 1.3.13 fails to install with: "OSError: mysql_config not found"
#   - version 1.4.6 works fine
#
# Then, because we started at 2.01 Gb:
#
# - remove packages that we don't need, all within a single RUN command...
#   ... takes it from 2.01 Gb to 1.58 Gb
#   ... and moving from python:3.6-slim-buster to python:3.7-slim-buster takes
#       it from 1.58 Gb to 1.59 Gb, so no real difference there.
