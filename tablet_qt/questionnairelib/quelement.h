===============================================================================
Constructing element lists and pages
===============================================================================

 - When we make a Page of Elements, we have to use pointers, because we are
   going to be using polymorphic objects that inherit from Element, and we
   can't have a list of Elements (that may not be base class Elements)
   without using pointers.
   Example:
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7223613/c-polymorphism-without-pointers
 - Moreover, we cannot create a plain object then take a pointer from
   its address, since we'd be constructing the objects on the stack (by a
   task's edit() function), and they'd be destroyed before we want to use
   them (via a Qt call to the Questionnaire object).
 - So, we must create them on the heap with "new".
 - However, we want to be able to use method chaining, e.g.

      Text& bold() { ... return *this; }
      // ...
      ... Text("content").bold() ...

   But that doesn't work with "new".

   So it seems we must do:

      Text* bold() { ... return this; }
      // ...
      ... ElementPtr((new Text("content"))->bold()) ...

 - One other thing to look at: std::reference_wrapper
   ... but that still requires the objects to stay in scope:
       http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33110013/polymorphism-in-c-with-a-vector-with-base-classes-and-reference-wrapper

 - So, ElementPtr and "return this" it is.
 - We also have to create Questionnaire objects using "new", since they are
   Qt objects that Qt will manage.
 - It therefore seems a bit inconsistent to create Page objects on the stack
   and copy them, as that'd give odd-one-out usage.
 - So, pointers all the way in the Questionnaire system.

 - AH, NO. MORE ELEGANT (AND MUCH MORE READABLE FOR TASKS) IS THIS:

    - implement clone() method
    - Text& bold() { ... return *this; }
    - Text("content").bold().clone()

 - We could, ordinarily, implement the clone method automatically using CRTP.
   Search for "FighterPlane" in qt_notes.txt.
   However, this throws up a whole bunch of errors in QObject-derived objects,
   relating to
     - cannot convert from pointer to base class 'QObject' to pointer to
       derived class 'QuButton' via virtual base 'QuElement'
     - use of deleted function...
     - QObject::QObject(const QObject&) is private
       in definition of macro 'Q_DISABLE_COPY'
 - ... so do that by hand?
 - Still have similar problems relating to Q_DISABLE_COPY
    https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.5/qobject.html#Q_DISABLE_COPY
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2855495/qobject-cloning
 - So can we make elements *not* inherit from QObject? We're only deriving
   so we can receive signals.
   Yes, we can use a Handler:
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7502600/how-to-use-signal-and-slot-without-deriving-from-qobject
   or a lambda/more generic functor:
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26937517/qt-connect-without-qobject-or-slots
        https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.5/qobject.html#connect-4

 - HOWEVER, ONCE YOU ADD SIGNALS TO NON-QOBJECT OBJECTS WITH std::bind,
   the process of copying BREAKS THE SIGNAL.
   So either we have to have a two-phase process, saying "whatever you do,
   don't set up signals in your creation process", and have the Questionnaire
   set them up later (ugly, dangerous), or we just have to PROHIBIT COPYING,
   like QObject does. You see why...
 - In which case, we're back to the slightly uglier way, using pointers.
 - Ho hum, it's worth it for flexibility.
 - And if you're going to make them non-copyable, make them QObjects,
   to prevent accidental copying. Embrace the QObject!

===============================================================================
Widgets
===============================================================================

- Element widgets will be made using "new" and owned by Qt as usual.
- But we might like to access them +/- cache them.
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331396/how-does-qt-delete-objects-and-what-is-the-best-way-to-store-qobjects
- Using a shared pointer for a QObject is tricky
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34433435/why-dont-the-official-qt-examples-and-tutorials-use-smart-pointers
- The proper way to hold a pointer to a QObject (particularly when you are not
  an appropriately lifetime-limited QObject yourself) is with a QPointer.
