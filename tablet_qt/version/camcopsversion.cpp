// It is NOT normal to have to increase this if you add a new task.
// You should be overriding minimumServerVersion() for the new task instead.
// Only change this if aspects of the core server tables or API change in a
// breaking way.
// (Why? Suppose you are running an old server, and your users download a newer
// client; they should still be able to operate as long as they're not trying
// to create/upload tasks that you don't yet support.)
// See also other upload-related version constants in networkmanager.cpp.
