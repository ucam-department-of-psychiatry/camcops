    Excellent description of the bitwise formats:
    http://steve.hollasch.net/cgindex/coding/ieeefloat.html

    "The sign bit is 0 for positive, 1 for negative.
    The exponent base is two.
    The exponent field contains 127 plus the true exponent for single-
    precision, or 1023 plus the true exponent for double precision.
    The first bit of the mantissa is typically assumed to be 1.f, where f is
    the field of fraction bits."

    "Floating point numbers are typically stored in normalized form.
    This basically puts the radix point after the fist non-zero digit.
    In normalized form, five is represented as 5.000 x 10^0."

    RNC attempt:
    See http://www.binaryconvert.com/convert_double.html

    Take the specimen number 1.
    1 -> sign 0, exponent 0x3FF, mantissa 0
     ... full version: 0x3FF0000000000000 or:
    00111111 11110000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000

    Now, following ieee754.h and my equivalent in floatbits.h:
    With S sign, E exponent, M mantissa0 (high bits), m mantissa1 (low bits)
    Big-endian: memory left to right:

    00111111 11110000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
