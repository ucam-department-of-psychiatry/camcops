    1.  These parameters are the GLM versions. We start with these.
        The GLM, ignoring error terms, is:

            Y = logistic(Xb) = logistic(b0 + b1*x)
            logit(Y) = Xb = b0 + b1*x

        The Y value, here, is the probability p, so:

            p = logistic(b0 + b1*x)
              = 1 / (1 + exp(-[b0 + b1*x]));
            logit(p) = b0 + b1*x

        Reversing:

            x = (logit(p) - b0) / b1

        Or, reversing in full:

            P = 1 / (1 + exp(-intercept - slope * X))
            1 = P + P * exp(-intercept - slope * X)
            -intercept - slope*X = ln((1 - P) / P)
            intercept + slope * X = ln(P / (1 - P))
            X = (ln(P / (1 - P)) - intercept) / slope

    2.  From an alternative formulation:
        These parameters define a linear equation in logits,
            L(X) = intercept + slope * X
        The logistic function itself is
            P = plogis(L) = 0.5 * (1 + tanh(L/2)) = 1 / (1 + exp(-L))
        So that's
            P = 1 / (1 + exp(-intercept - slope * X))
        Comparing to Lecluyse & Meddis (2009)'s function,
            p = 1 / (1 + exp(-k(X - theta)))
              = 1 / (1 + exp(-k*X + k*theta))),
        we have
            k = slope
        and
            theta = -intercept/k = -intercept/slope

        Comparing back to the GLM function:

            intercept = b0
            slope = b1
            k = slope = b1
            theta = -intercept/k = -b0/b1      [... since k*theta = -intercept]

    3.  We will have p = 0.5 when

            0.5 = 1 / (1 + exp(-[b0 + b1*x]))
            1 + exp(-[b0 + b1*x]) = 2
            exp(-[b0 + b1*x]) = 1
            -[b0 + b1*x] = 0
            b0 + b1*x = 0
            x = -b0/b1
              = theta
