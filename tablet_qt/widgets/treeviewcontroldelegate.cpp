The information coming here seems insufficient.

Should we instead be overriding QTreeView::drawBranches, or setting a new
widget style() for QTreeView::drawBranches to use when it calls
    style()->drawPrimitive(QStyle::PE_IndicatorBranch, &opt, painter, this);
?

Perhaps we should use a proxy style. See TreeViewProxyStyle.
