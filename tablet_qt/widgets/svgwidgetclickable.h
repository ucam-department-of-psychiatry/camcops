class SvgWidgetClickable : public QSvgWidget
{
    // Widget that displays an SVG graphics image, and is clickable.
    // Used for response elements (e.g. in ID/ED-3D task).
    //
    // We have a choice of deriving from QGraphicsSvgItem or QSvgWidget.
    // The main differences are:
    //
    // - QSvgWidget can be used in a more general context
    // - QSvgWidget owns its QSvgRenderer, but you can access it, while if you
    //   use a QGraphicsSvgItem, you have to manage the lifetime of the
    //   renderer separately, which is something of a pain.
    //
    // For clicks:
    // - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36372615/
    //
    // For changing the background colour when pressed:
    // - The ":pseudo" stylesheet selector doesn't work; possibly that's
    //   only for QAbstractButton.
    // - You can't both override paintEvent() and call the base class
    //   implementation?
    //   - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13897026/
    //   - https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.5/qpainter.html#begin
    // - Aha! You can. You just have to ensure the first QPainter is destroyed
    //   first. Done.
