{
    // Class intended as the viewport widget for VerticalScrollArea, to
    // replace the default implementation of QScrollArea, which uses a plain
    // QWidget as its viewport.
    //
    // The main thing is that it has a DIRECT CHILD WIDGET, given to it by
    // the scroll area, not a layout.
    //
    // And the thing we need to avoid is that the child widget gets its height
    // set based on its sizeHint(), without any reference to heightForWidth().
    //
    // HOWEVER, resizeEvent() is not called when we resize the
    // VerticalScrollArea, and setGeometry() is not virtual, so this is not
    // much use. (If called via a QWidget*, as in
    // QAbstractScrollAreaPrivate::layoutChildren(), the base class
    // QWidget::setGeometry() will be called.)
