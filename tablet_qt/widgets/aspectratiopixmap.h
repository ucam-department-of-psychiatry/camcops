#include <QLabel>
#include <QWidget>
class QMouseEvent;
class QResizeEvent;

class AspectRatioPixmap : public QWidget
{
    // Image that retains its aspect ratio, for displaying photos.
    //
    // - Displays image UP TO its original size.
    //
    // - Clickable, in a simple way (as per
    //   https://wiki.qt.io/Clickable_QLabel).
    //
    //   - this form of clicking responds immediately, not as you release the
    //     mouse click (cf. QAbstractButton); however, there is no visual
    //     display that responds to the start of the click, so maybe that is
    //     reasonable.
    //   - For another way of responding to clicks, see ClickableLabel.

    // For speed, DO NOT allow resizeEvent() to call some sort of function like
    // QLabel::setPixmap(scaledPixmap()). That leads to terminal slowness with
    // large images.
    // Instead, store a size, and plot the image to that size as required.
    // Compare CanvasWidget, which also does that.
