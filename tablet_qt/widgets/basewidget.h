class BaseWidget : public QWidget
{
    // Generic base widget class for CamCOPS. It has two functions, one
    // superseded and #defined out.
    //
    // (1) If GUI_USE_RESIZE_FOR_HEIGHT is defined, this is a widget that knows
    // that its layout implements a height-for-width function and deals with it
    // properly, adjusting the widget's height to the layout (and its
    // contents).
    //
    // - SPECIFICALLY: IT WILL REDUCE ITS HEIGHT (TO FIT THE CONTENTS) AS THE
    //   LAYOUT SPREADS OUT CHILD WIDGETS TO THE RIGHT (in a way that a plain
    //   QWidget won't).
    //
    // - ... and will also set a correct MINIMUM HEIGHT as the width shrinks.
    //
    // - Use this when you want to put a FlowLayout in (e.g. see QuMCQ).
    //
    // - You might also use this when you want a widget containing a layout
    //   containing a LabelWordWrapWide object, or similar (e.g. see
    //   ClickableLabelWordWrapWide -- though that has to re-implement, not
    //   inherit, for Qt inheritance reasons).
    //
    // However, this system is INFERIOR to using a proper layout; see
    // BoxLayoutHfw and its children, for example. We have therefore moved AWAY
    // from GUI_USE_RESIZE_FOR_HEIGHT; see gui_defines.h.
    //
    // (2) This also enables our widgets to support stylesheets; see below.
