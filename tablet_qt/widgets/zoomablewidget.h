    // - A scale of 1.0 means "life-sized".
    //
    // - contents: widget to be encapsulated.
    // - can_scale_smaller_than_viewport: can we shrink the contents smaller
    //   than the viewport? Using "true" is unusual!
    // - min_scale: minimum scale permitted (subject to
    //   can_scale_smaller_than_viewport).
    // - max_scale: maximum scale permitted.
    // - scale_step_factor: a single notch of a mouse wheel zooms in/out by
    //   this factor.
    // - minimum_size: how small can this widget go? Since it zooms its
    //   contents, this can be pretty small.
    // - parent: widget's parent (optional)
