Standard Cartesian/polar coordinate systems
===============================================================================

- Positive x is to the right.
- Positive y is UP.
- Positive theta is ANTICLOCKWISE, and theta = 0 is at the 3 o'clock position.
  ... so for a point (x=1, y=0), positive rotation moves it in the direction of
  INCREASING y.
  When you rotate by theta, you rotate anticlockwise.
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_of_axes

The Qt coordinate system
===============================================================================

- Positive x is to the right.
- Positive y is DOWN. (This matches commonplace screen coordinates; the origin
  is at the top left.)
  https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.5/coordsys.html

- When you rotate a coordinate system, rotation angles are CLOCKWISE.
  https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.5/qpainter.html#rotate
  ... so for a point (x=1, y=0), positive rotation moves it in the direction of
  INCREASING y.

- But when you draw a pie, rotation angles are ANTICLOCKWISE, and zero degrees
  is in the 3 o'clock position.
  https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.5/qpainter.html#drawPie

- Other ANTICLOCKWISE bits:
  - QTranform::rotate
    https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.5/qtransform.html#rotate

- Qt also uses a "positive ANTICLOCKWISE" system for its graphs, though that's
  more obvious as it's mimicking standard graph geometry here.
  https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.5/qtcharts-polarchart-example.html

Which representation to use internally for polar coordinates?
===============================================================================

- Any sophisticated representations are going to assume a standard Cartesian
  system and the most important part of that isn't "up"/"down" but the fact
  that positive angles are anticlockwise WITH RESPECT TO "x right, y up", i.e.
  that positive rotation moves the point (x=1, y=0) in the direction of
  INCREASING y.

  That's helpful so we can use standard representations like
        x = r * cos(theta)      y = r * sin(theta)
  not
        x = r * cos(theta)      y = -r * sin(theta)

- That means angles are clockwise in the standard Qt coordinates.

- So we'll use that when we refer to "polar", and convert explicitly for those
  places (like pie drawing) where anticlockwise angles are required.

Compass headings
===============================================================================

- These are based on the idea of "North up" (though also support a
  transformation via an "alternative North"), and positive rotation is
  CLOCKWISE.

Other notes on Qt coordinates
===============================================================================

- QPainter::drawText()

  "The y-position is used as the baseline of the font."

  So if you draw at y = 3, it'll be bottom-aligned there.
  To top-align it, add its height to the y coordinate.
  To vcentre-align it, add half its height to the y coordinate.

  To left-align it, plot at the unmodified x coordinate.
  To centre-align it, subtract half its width from the x coordinate.
  To right-align it, subtract its width from the x coordinate.
