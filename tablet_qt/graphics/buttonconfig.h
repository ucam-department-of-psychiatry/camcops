// Represents a graphical button with text in it.

// We use pixels, not points, for font sizes here.
// In general, this is deprecated, because it makes things device-specific,
// i.e. dependent on the dots-per-inch (DPI) setting. However, in this context
// we are working in a pixel-based graphics system, which is then scaled by the
// ScreenLikeGraphicsView. It's not clear that "DPI" makes sense here, and we
// want our text size to be predictable.
