/*

This proxy model makes a flat model out of a tree, so we can use a QListView
for searching.

It also ensures we can't see/pick something marked as unselectable.

This is pretty basic; see

    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21564976/how-to-create-a-proxy-model-that-would-flatten-nodes-of-a-qabstractitemmodel-int

but for more extensive things, Google also "FlatProxyModel"; there are others,
e.g.
    https://api.kde.org/bundled-apps-api/calligra-apidocs/plan/html/kptflatproxymodel_8h_source.html
    https://api.kde.org/bundled-apps-api/calligra-apidocs/plan/html/kptflatproxymodel_8cpp_source.html

However, also:

    http://www.qtcentre.org/threads/25884-Proxy-model-index-mapping

... you can't reimplement mapFromSource() and mapToSource() for
    QSortFilterProxyModel because it needs its own implementation; instead
    subclass QAbstractProxyModel to do the flattening, and either flatten
    something filtered or (in our case) filter something flattened.
