QSizePolicy: https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.5/qsizepolicy.html

    QSizePolicy::GrowFlag	1
        The widget can grow beyond its size hint if necessary.
    QSizePolicy::ExpandFlag	2
        The widget should get as much space as possible.
    QSizePolicy::ShrinkFlag	4
        The widget can shrink below its size hint if necessary.
    QSizePolicy::IgnoreFlag	8
        The widget's size hint is ignored. The widget will get as much space as
        possible.

So...

Fixed = 0

    "Be exactly size X."

Minimum = GrowFlag

    "Be at least X. I don't need more, but you can give me more."

Maximum = ShrinkFlag

    "Be at most X. You can shrink me if you want."

Preferred = GrowFlag | ShrinkFlag

    "I'd like to be X. You can shrink me if you want. You can enlarge me if
    you want, but I don't need more."

MinimumExpanding = GrowFlag | ExpandFlag

    "Be at least X, but I'd like to be as large as possible."

Expanding = GrowFlag | ShrinkFlag | ExpandFlag

    "X is a reasonable size. You can enlarge or shrink me if you want, but
    I'd like to be as large as possible."

Ignored = ShrinkFlag | GrowFlag | IgnoreFlag

    "Be as large as possible!"

When the "height-for-width" flag is set, meaning "my height depends on my
width", these get more complicated -- see below.

The names of all the functions below have the horizontal policy then the
vertical policy.
