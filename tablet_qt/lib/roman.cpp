    This is not the most concise, perhaps; for example, it converts 1999
    to MCMXCIX, rather than MIM. Still, good enough for what we want.

    Anyway, what's "correct"?

    https://www.infoplease.com/askeds/1999-roman-numerals

    Q. Is the "official" Roman numeral for 1999 MCMXCIX or MIM?
    A. According to librarians at the National Institute of Standards and
       Technology, while MIM is more convenient, MCMXCIX is favored because of
       earlier precedents with numbers such as 49 (written as XLIX rather than
       IL); however, the librarians point out that purists use neither MIM nor
       MCMXCIX, opting instead for MCMXCVIIII. The ancient Romans, they
       explain, did not use the 20th century convention of IX for the number
       nine.
